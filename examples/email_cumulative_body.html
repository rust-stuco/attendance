  <p>Hello!</p>
  <p>If you're reading this, our records show that you have <b>two unexcused absences.</b> We started counting absences starting from week 4, after the Add deadline.</p>
  <p>Please note that you are allowed up to and including two unexcused absences. <b>If you have more than two unexcused absences, we are required to fail you by StuCo guidelines.</b>
    We'd hate to do that! This is easily prevented by emailing us ahead of time that you will be absent for any good enough reason.</p>
  <p>If you believe that there is some sort of mistake, please let us know ASAP. We can let you know which weeks we have you recorded as absent.<p>
  <p>Best,</p>
  <p>98008 Staff ðŸ¦€</p>
